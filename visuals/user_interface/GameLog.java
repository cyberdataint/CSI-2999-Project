     *      moves done:
     *          (Knight [E4] -> [B7]) 
     *      pieces taken:
     *          (White Knight [E4] took  Black Bishop [B7])
     *      converting pawn to Queen, etc:
     *          (White Pawn [E4] became White Queen [E4]), 
     *      game start and game end:
     *          (Game Start!)
     *          (Game Finished! White wins!)
     *  this will also include a scrolling pane so users can
     *  scroll up to see previous messages
